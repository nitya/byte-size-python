# Byte-Size Python
Notes and code from working through [Byte Size Python with AJ](https://www.amazon.com/Bite-Size-Python-Introduction-Programming/dp/1119643813) | Goal is to do these in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

## Projects

These are the projects in the book. Each project is being created in it's own Notebook.
 * (Ch 4) Meet Your Classmates
 * (Ch 5) Shopping for Science Fair Supplies
 * (Ch 6) Mad Libs Generator
 * (Ch 7) What to Wear
 * (Ch 9) Find the Green Marble
 * (Ch 10) Kickball teams
 * (Ch 11) Customer Service Bot
 * (Ch 12) School Musical Signups

## Chapter 1

Just set up Jupyter Notebook to capture notes and do interactive learning/testing.

## Chapter 2

First we document our environments (NN | AJ). We both use MacOS for our development environment.

 * Python  (3.8.3 | 3.6.0)
 * VS Code (1.47.3 | 1.43.2)
 * Anaconda (1.9.12 )
 * Jupyter Notebook (6.0.3)

## Chapter 3

 * Book recommends IDLE. 
 * We chose to use Jupyter notebooks and VS Code + Commandline (conda) environments interchangeably for our learning.

## Chapter 4

We learn about variables, variable names and data types supported in Python. We also learned to print variable values. And update variables.

Variables are containers for data. The variable name can then be used to represent the data at any place in the code - making the code easier to read.

We also experimented with printing things out, and learned that there are simple data types (integer, string, float, boolean) that store a single value and complex data types (list, set etc.) that can store a collection of values.

We also learned about the `input` method which allows you to get input from the user via the commandline, and assign the value to a variable.

We also explored the `title` method which can work on strings to capitalize the first character. This was useful for the first project!
