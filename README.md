# Byte-Size Python
Notes and code from working through [Byte Size Python with AJ](https://www.amazon.com/Bite-Size-Python-Introduction-Programming/dp/1119643813) | Goal is to do these in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)


## Chapter 2

First we document our environments (NN | AJ). We both use MacOS for our development environment.

 * Python  (3.8.3 | 3.6.0)
 * VS Code (1.47.3 | 1.43.2)
 * Anaconda (1.9.12 )
 * Jupyter Notebook (6.0.3)

## Chapter 3

 * Book recommends IDLE. 
 * We chose to use Jupyter notebooks and VS Code + Commandline (conda) environments interchangeably for our learning.
